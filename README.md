# Credit Card Customer Segmentation

In this project, I will be using data about a credit card company's customers to segment the the customers into different groups and develop insights and draw conclusions about these groups and their tendencies/use of their credit cards.

Creating these different groups allows the company to apply different business strategies for each of the groups depending on the tendencies they have

I will be using an **unsupervised machine learning** model and using **K means clustering** to segment the customers
